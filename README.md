## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Laptop-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code
- Google fonts
- Font Awesome

### What I learned

I learnt a lot while undergoing this task, especially getting to learn and implement CSS Flexbox and Grid. I'm used to float and CSS Box model to position my contents and style my layouts. This is far more easier especially to create responsive websites. 

```html
<div class="container">
  <div> Content 1</div>
  <div> Content 2 </div>
  <div> Content 3</div>
  <div> Content 4</div>
</div>
```
```css
.container {
  color: papayawhip;
  display: flex;  /* Using Flexbox */
  justify-content: center;
}

/* To make it responsive */
 @media(max-width:375px){
     .container{
       flex-direction:column;
     }
 }
```

### Continued development

Now I have gotten a good background on HTML and CSS, I will move to Javascript in order to complete my Frontend course. And the technique I learnt from this project that I will stick to, is using CSS Flexbox and Grid to make responsive websites.
